service:
  type: ClusterIP

  # A different port that 80, which can cause conflicts when hostNetworkIP is set.
  containerPort: 5398

  # When Kubernetes supports port -1 to mean all ports for
  # ClusterIP or LoadBalancer, you can use the following without hostNetworkIP:
  # rtpPort: -1

  # Set this to use hostNetwork: true on pods, and schedule only where
  # <hostNetworkIPSelector>=<hostNetworkIP>
  # hostNetworkIP: 192.168.1.25
  # You will need to label your node with
  #   kubectl label node <MY-PUBLIC-NODE> hostNetworkIP=192.168.1.25
  # and the server will only run on that node with hostNetwork: true

  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
